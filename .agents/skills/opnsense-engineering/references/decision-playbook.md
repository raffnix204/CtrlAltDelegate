# OPNsense Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from live topology/addressing, management/recovery paths, control-plane ownership, current firmware/controller versions and a before-change state capture.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Identify OPNsense edition/version, relevant MVC/API modules and existing configuration ownership before assuming every GUI field has the same API path.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 2. Use dedicated API keys/users with only required effective privileges and protect key/secret material from logs/repositories.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 3. Prefer documented API modules and inspect the actual GUI/API request path when current documentation is incomplete, without bypassing authentication or controls.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 4. For firewall/NAT changes, preserve established rule order/state and management-plane access

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 5. Understand which automation/API components manage only their own rule/model sets so changes do not accidentally ignore legacy/manual configuration.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 6. Coordinate DHCP/DNS/routing/VPN/interface changes across dependent services and reload/apply semantics.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 7. Validate service status, routes, rules, DNS/DHCP, VPN and real traffic after API success

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.
