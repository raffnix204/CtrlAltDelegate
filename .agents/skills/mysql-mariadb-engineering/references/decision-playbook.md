# MySQL & MariaDB Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from data ownership, schema/cardinality, representative access/write patterns, consistency/transaction boundaries, retention and production-scale evidence.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Identify exact engine and version before relying on syntax or behavior because MySQL and MariaDB diverge in features and deprecations.

- **Watch for:** version/capability mismatch, removed/renamed behavior, undocumented defaults or a client/provider assumption that differs from the deployed target.
- **Prove with:** detected runtime/server/client/provider versions, current first-party capability/schema documentation and representative success/error operations.
- **Safe change pattern:** bind behavior to discovered capabilities, isolate compatibility branches and record the verified version/capability set with the evidence.

## 2. Use InnoDB, utf8mb4, exact numeric types and explicit constraints/defaults appropriate to the target version.

- **Watch for:** version/capability mismatch, removed/renamed behavior, undocumented defaults or a client/provider assumption that differs from the deployed target.
- **Prove with:** detected runtime/server/client/provider versions, current first-party capability/schema documentation and representative success/error operations.
- **Safe change pattern:** bind behavior to discovered capabilities, isolate compatibility branches and record the verified version/capability set with the evidence.

## 3. Design composite indexes from equality/range/order predicates and verify with EXPLAIN/ANALYZE rather than adding indexes by intuition.

- **Watch for:** silent loss/duplication, incompatible readers/writers, unbounded growth, hot partitions, lock amplification, stale derived state or access paths that collapse at realistic cardinality.
- **Prove with:** representative data volume, invariants/counts/checksums, explain/access-path evidence, latency/resource/lock metrics and retry/failure cases.
- **Safe change pattern:** make ownership/schema/consistency explicit, use backward-compatible expand/contract changes and keep backfills/rebuilds bounded, resumable and verifiable.

## 4. Understand transaction isolation, gap/next-key locks, deadlocks and retryable transaction patterns for concurrent workloads.

- **Watch for:** silent loss/duplication, incompatible readers/writers, unbounded growth, hot partitions, lock amplification, stale derived state or access paths that collapse at realistic cardinality.
- **Prove with:** representative data volume, invariants/counts/checksums, explain/access-path evidence, latency/resource/lock metrics and retry/failure cases.
- **Safe change pattern:** make ownership/schema/consistency explicit, use backward-compatible expand/contract changes and keep backfills/rebuilds bounded, resumable and verifiable.

## 5. Use keyset pagination and queue patterns carefully

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 6. Plan online/large-table schema changes and replication impact with `database-migrations`

- **Watch for:** silent loss/duplication, incompatible readers/writers, unbounded growth, hot partitions, lock amplification, stale derived state or access paths that collapse at realistic cardinality.
- **Prove with:** representative data volume, invariants/counts/checksums, explain/access-path evidence, latency/resource/lock metrics and retry/failure cases.
- **Safe change pattern:** make ownership/schema/consistency explicit, use backward-compatible expand/contract changes and keep backfills/rebuilds bounded, resumable and verifiable.

## 7. Treat replica lag and read-after-write semantics explicitly when routing reads.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.
