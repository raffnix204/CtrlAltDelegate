# gRPC & Protobuf Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from repository/runtime ownership, current versions/capabilities, public contracts, failure semantics and representative acceptance evidence.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Treat field numbers and wire types as durable compatibility identifiers

- **Watch for:** version/capability mismatch, removed/renamed behavior, undocumented defaults or a client/provider assumption that differs from the deployed target.
- **Prove with:** detected runtime/server/client/provider versions, current first-party capability/schema documentation and representative success/error operations.
- **Safe change pattern:** bind behavior to discovered capabilities, isolate compatibility branches and record the verified version/capability set with the evidence.

## 2. Model messages for evolution with optional/presence semantics and additive changes

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.

## 3. Set deadlines/cancellation and propagate them through downstream calls

- **Watch for:** hidden ownership ambiguity, non-idempotent recovery, accidental compatibility breaks or behavior that is only locally correct.
- **Prove with:** repository/runtime evidence plus representative success/failure/compatibility checks and the smallest domain-native telemetry needed to falsify the decision.
- **Safe change pattern:** make ownership/failure semantics explicit, preserve supported compatibility and keep a reversible path until the new behavior is proven.

## 4. Configure retries only for safe/idempotent methods and understand interaction with load balancing and server work.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 5. Use streaming only when data/latency semantics require it and handle flow control/backpressure/cancellation.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 6. Map authn/authz and error status/details consistently across languages and gateways.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 7. Verify cross-version client/server compatibility and actual generated artifacts in every supported language.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.
