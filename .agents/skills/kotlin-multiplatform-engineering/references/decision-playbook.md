# Kotlin Multiplatform Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from supported OS/runtime/toolchain versions, lifecycle/concurrency model, interop boundaries, packaging/deployment target and clean-environment reproduction.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Put genuinely platform-independent domain/data logic in common source sets and resist forcing UI/native platform APIs through awkward abstractions.

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.

## 2. Use expect/actual or interface injection only for real platform differences

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 3. Design coroutine dispatching and lifecycle ownership so common code does not assume Android or iOS threading semantics.

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.

## 4. Choose shared networking/serialization/database libraries based on target support and current maturity

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.

## 5. Expose Swift-friendly APIs to iOS and account for generated framework/export behavior, nullability, exceptions and suspend interop.

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.

## 6. Test common logic once plus platform integrations on each actual target.

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.

## 7. Treat Kotlin/compiler/Gradle/plugin version compatibility as a coordinated matrix during upgrades.

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.
