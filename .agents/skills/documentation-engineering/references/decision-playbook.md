# Documentation Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from repository/runtime ownership, current versions/capabilities, public contracts, failure semantics and representative acceptance evidence.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Assign each durable fact one canonical owner and link from other docs instead of copying contradictory versions across README/architecture/status files.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 2. Write setup/quick-start commands that run from a clean environment and include prerequisites/configuration without secrets.

- **Watch for:** over-privileged identities, secret exposure, missing revocation/rotation, confused-deputy behavior or sensitive material leaking into logs/artifacts.
- **Prove with:** effective scopes/roles plus positive and negative permission cases, redacted telemetry and rotation/revocation or signature/certificate validation where relevant.
- **Safe change pattern:** use dedicated least-privilege identities, external secret storage and short-lived/rotatable credentials where supported.

## 3. Generate API docs from authoritative contracts where possible and document errors, auth, pagination, examples and versioning.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 4. Record hard-to-reverse design decisions in ADRs

- **Watch for:** hidden ownership ambiguity, non-idempotent recovery, accidental compatibility breaks or behavior that is only locally correct.
- **Prove with:** repository/runtime evidence plus representative success/failure/compatibility checks and the smallest domain-native telemetry needed to falsify the decision.
- **Safe change pattern:** make ownership/failure semantics explicit, preserve supported compatibility and keep a reversible path until the new behavior is proven.

## 5. Maintain changelog/release/migration notes around user/operator impact, breaking changes and exact upgrade steps.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 6. Keep current status separate from architecture/history so stale milestones do not masquerade as design truth.

- **Watch for:** hidden ownership ambiguity, non-idempotent recovery, accidental compatibility breaks or behavior that is only locally correct.
- **Prove with:** repository/runtime evidence plus representative success/failure/compatibility checks and the smallest domain-native telemetry needed to falsify the decision.
- **Safe change pattern:** make ownership/failure semantics explicit, preserve supported compatibility and keep a reversible path until the new behavior is proven.

## 7. Verify links, commands, examples and referenced paths during relevant changes

- **Watch for:** ambiguous output/exit semantics, shell quoting/path/Unicode breakage, prompts in automation, partial writes or destructive scope that cannot be previewed.
- **Prove with:** TTY and non-TTY runs, representative shells/paths/Unicode, success/error exit codes, machine-readable output and cancellation/partial-write cases.
- **Safe change pattern:** treat grammar/stdout/stderr/exit codes as a public contract, keep non-interactive mode deterministic and provide dry-run/explicit scope for destructive operations where practical.
