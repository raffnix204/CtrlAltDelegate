# Release & Package Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from repository-owned commands, declared toolchain/lock inputs, build graph, artifact provenance, supported consumers and target release/deployment behavior.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Define release units and versioning policy from compatibility expectations

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.

## 2. Build artifacts from clean, immutable source commits and record toolchain/dependency provenance so releases can be reproduced and audited.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 3. Sign artifacts/packages where the ecosystem supports it and protect publishing credentials through short-lived or environment-scoped identities.

- **Watch for:** over-privileged identities, secret exposure, missing revocation/rotation, confused-deputy behavior or sensitive material leaking into logs/artifacts.
- **Prove with:** effective scopes/roles plus positive and negative permission cases, redacted telemetry and rotation/revocation or signature/certificate validation where relevant.
- **Safe change pattern:** use dedicated least-privilege identities, external secret storage and short-lived/rotatable credentials where supported.

## 4. Generate release notes from user-visible changes and migration requirements, not raw commit dumps

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 5. Separate build, verification and publish stages

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 6. Exercise rollback/unpublish constraints before release, especially where registries or mobile stores make reversal difficult.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 7. Verify install/upgrade paths from a clean environment and from the previous supported version.

- **Watch for:** version/capability mismatch, removed/renamed behavior, undocumented defaults or a client/provider assumption that differs from the deployed target.
- **Prove with:** detected runtime/server/client/provider versions, current first-party capability/schema documentation and representative success/error operations.
- **Safe change pattern:** bind behavior to discovered capabilities, isolate compatibility branches and record the verified version/capability set with the evidence.
