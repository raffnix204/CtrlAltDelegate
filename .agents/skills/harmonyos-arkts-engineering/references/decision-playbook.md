# HarmonyOS & ArkTS Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from supported OS/runtime/toolchain versions, lifecycle/concurrency model, interop boundaries, packaging/deployment target and clean-environment reproduction.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Verify the targeted HarmonyOS/SDK/ArkTS version because platform APIs and toolchains evolve quickly.

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.

## 2. Model application/ability/component lifecycle explicitly and release resources when pages/components background or disappear.

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.

## 3. Use ArkUI state primitives according to ownership and avoid hidden global mutable state across UI scopes.

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.

## 4. Request only necessary platform permissions and design denied/revoked behavior as normal user flows.

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.

## 5. Keep networking, persistence and business logic separated from UI components for testability.

- **Watch for:** runtime/OS/toolchain mismatch, lifecycle/threading violations, unsafe interop, ABI/encoding/path assumptions or behavior that only succeeds on one local machine.
- **Prove with:** current toolchain/runtime evidence, platform-native tests on supported targets, lifecycle/concurrency failure cases and clean build/package/install evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** use platform-native contracts first, isolate interop/platform-specific code, record support floors and test on real target runners/devices.

## 6. Test on actual/emulated target devices across lifecycle, orientation/window and network transitions.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 7. Verify signing, bundle/module packaging and store/device deployment requirements from current official sources before release.

- **Watch for:** over-privileged identities, secret exposure, missing revocation/rotation, confused-deputy behavior or sensitive material leaking into logs/artifacts.
- **Prove with:** effective scopes/roles plus positive and negative permission cases, redacted telemetry and rotation/revocation or signature/certificate validation where relevant.
- **Safe change pattern:** use dedicated least-privilege identities, external secret storage and short-lived/rotatable credentials where supported.
