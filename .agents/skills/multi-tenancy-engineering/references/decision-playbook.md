# Multi-Tenancy Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from actor/tenant boundaries, authority, sensitive state transitions, audit/reconciliation requirements and exceptional/recovery paths.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Choose tenancy model—shared schema with tenant key/RLS, schema-per-tenant, database-per-tenant or hybrid—from isolation, scale and operations requirements.

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.

## 2. Carry tenant context explicitly from authenticated request/job/event boundaries and never infer it from user-controlled object identifiers.

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.

## 3. Enforce isolation at multiple appropriate layers and write negative cross-tenant tests

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.

## 4. Partition caches, search/vector indexes, object storage keys and background jobs by tenant as carefully as primary database rows.

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.

## 5. Design tenant-aware migrations/backfills, quotas/rate limits, billing/entitlements and deletion/export workflows.

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.

## 6. Keep operator/support impersonation or cross-tenant admin paths auditable and tightly privileged.

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.

## 7. Include tenant identity in logs/metrics safely for diagnosis without leaking one tenant's data to another.

- **Watch for:** cross-tenant/resource access, policy bypass through alternate paths, stale authorization caches or privileged actions without auditable ownership.
- **Prove with:** positive and negative authorization cases across representative roles/tenants/resources, including alternate entry points and privileged/bypass identities.
- **Safe change pattern:** centralize the authoritative policy boundary, default deny on ambiguity and keep tenant/resource identity attached through derived/cache/index layers.
