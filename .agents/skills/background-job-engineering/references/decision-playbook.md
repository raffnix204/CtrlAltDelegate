# Background Job & Worker Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from durable handoff/ownership, effect identity, delivery/order semantics, retry/backpressure and how work resumes after interruption.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Define why work is asynchronous and what completion means

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 2. Give jobs stable identifiers/idempotency keys and ensure retry cannot repeat external side effects unsafely.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 3. Use bounded retries with error classification and jitter

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 4. Control concurrency and rate limits against downstream capacity

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 5. Handle worker crashes and lease/visibility timeouts so abandoned work is recovered without duplicate corruption.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 6. Store progress/checkpoints only when tasks are long enough to need resume

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 7. Test scheduler duplication, clock/timezone behavior, deploys during work and poison-message scenarios.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.
