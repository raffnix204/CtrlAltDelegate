# Document Processing Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from source authority/trust, format/provenance contract, transformation stages, resource bounds and how derived output can be reproduced.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Identify whether the goal is text extraction, structure extraction, rendering fidelity, editing or format conversion

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 2. Prefer native digital text/structure extraction and use OCR only when the source is image-based or extraction fails materially.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 3. Treat complex documents as untrusted parser inputs and isolate converters with resource/time limits.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 4. Preserve page/section/table/source references so extracted facts can be traced back to the document.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 5. Validate output visually/structurally when layout matters

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 6. Handle passwords/encryption/access rights lawfully and never bypass protected content controls.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 7. For RAG/search ingestion, retain document version/hash and chunk provenance and design reprocessing when parsers/models change.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.
