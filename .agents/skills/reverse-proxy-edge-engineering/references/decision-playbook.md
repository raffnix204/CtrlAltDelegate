# Reverse Proxy & Edge Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from live topology/addressing, management/recovery paths, control-plane ownership, current firmware/controller versions and a before-change state capture.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Map incoming host/path/protocol routing and upstream ownership before editing shared proxy configuration.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 2. Terminate/pass through TLS deliberately, preserve client identity securely and set forwarding headers only from trusted proxy hops.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 3. Define timeouts and body/header limits by workload

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 4. Use health checks and graceful reloads, validating configuration before replacement

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 5. Apply caching only where response semantics permit it and make cache keys/vary rules/auth boundaries explicit.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 6. For WebSocket/SSE/gRPC, configure protocol upgrades, buffering and timeouts correctly.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 7. Protect admin/status endpoints, hide unnecessary version details and verify security headers at the application+edge composition boundary.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.
