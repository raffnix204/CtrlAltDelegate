# Web Data Acquisition Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from source authority/trust, format/provenance contract, transformation stages, resource bounds and how derived output can be reproduced.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Prefer official API/RSS/sitemap feeds when they provide the required data

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 2. Model acquisition as SEARCH/DISCOVER → MAP/FRONTIER → FETCH/SCRAPE → EXTRACT → NORMALIZE → DEDUP → STORE with explicit provenance.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 3. Respect authentication, robots/access controls, rate limits and site terms

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 4. Canonicalize URLs and content identities, handle redirects/pagination and prevent loops/duplicate crawl explosions.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 5. Use lightweight HTTP/content acquisition for textual corpora and escalate to real browser automation only for JS-rendered/interacted content that requires it.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 6. Persist fetch timestamp, source URL, content hash, extractor/version and errors so incremental refresh and audits are possible.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 7. Treat Firecrawl, compatible APIs, CRW or Pi-native tools as interchangeable providers of required capabilities, selected from the actual environment.

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.
