# Realtime Communications Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from durable handoff/ownership, effect identity, delivery/order semantics, retry/backpressure and how work resumes after interruption.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Choose SSE for server-to-client streams when bidirectional messaging is unnecessary

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 2. Define connection authentication/reauthentication, heartbeat/liveness, idle timeout and revocation semantics.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 3. Specify message IDs, ordering guarantees, duplicate handling, replay/resume and schema evolution

- **Watch for:** silent loss/duplication, incompatible readers/writers, unbounded growth, hot partitions, lock amplification, stale derived state or access paths that collapse at realistic cardinality.
- **Prove with:** representative data volume, invariants/counts/checksums, explain/access-path evidence, latency/resource/lock metrics and retry/failure cases.
- **Safe change pattern:** make ownership/schema/consistency explicit, use backward-compatible expand/contract changes and keep backfills/rebuilds bounded, resumable and verifiable.

## 4. Bound per-connection and server queues to prevent slow consumers from exhausting memory

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 5. Separate durable business events from ephemeral presence/typing signals and use a broker/backplane only when multi-instance fan-out requires it.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 6. Test network transitions, proxy timeouts, browser sleep, mobile reconnect and deploy/restart behavior.

- **Watch for:** management-path loss, wrong zone/VLAN/route/NAT semantics, asymmetric return traffic, MTU/IPv6 surprises or controller/device partial convergence.
- **Prove with:** before/after topology and config, live routes/neighbors/rules, service/device health, representative bidirectional client traffic, counters/logs and packet capture when needed.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve independent management or timed rollback, canary risky changes and widen only after live dataplane/service convergence.

## 7. Measure connection count, fan-out rate, send latency, queue depth and disconnect causes in production.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.
