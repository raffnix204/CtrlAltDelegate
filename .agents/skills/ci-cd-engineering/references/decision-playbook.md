# CI/CD Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from repository-owned commands, declared toolchain/lock inputs, build graph, artifact provenance, supported consumers and target release/deployment behavior.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Discover the repository's canonical build, lint, typecheck, unit, integration, E2E, migration and packaging commands before designing pipeline jobs.

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 2. Build the dependency graph explicitly so independent jobs parallelize while contract-sensitive work remains ordered

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 3. Use cache keys derived from lockfiles/toolchain inputs and distinguish caches from immutable artifacts

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 4. Prefer short-lived workload identity/OIDC over long-lived cloud credentials and scope permissions per job and environment.

- **Watch for:** over-privileged identities, secret exposure, missing revocation/rotation, confused-deputy behavior or sensitive material leaking into logs/artifacts.
- **Prove with:** effective scopes/roles plus positive and negative permission cases, redacted telemetry and rotation/revocation or signature/certificate validation where relevant.
- **Safe change pattern:** use dedicated least-privilege identities, external secret storage and short-lived/rotatable credentials where supported.

## 5. Design staging/production gates, deployment concurrency, rollback, canary/blue-green/rolling behavior and post-deploy verification around the actual runtime.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 6. Treat flaky tests as defects to diagnose, not as justification for blind retries or reduced coverage

- **Watch for:** duplicate external effects, lost acknowledgements, poison work, retry storms, out-of-order state, reconnect amplification or work that cannot resume after a crash.
- **Prove with:** forced duplicate/retry/crash/out-of-order cases plus queue/worker state, correlation IDs, durable checkpoint/ack evidence and final side-effect invariants.
- **Safe change pattern:** make effect identity/idempotency and responsibility transfer explicit, acknowledge only after durable handoff, bound retry/backoff and isolate poison work.

## 7. For monorepos, use affected-graph/path-aware execution only when it is trustworthy

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.
