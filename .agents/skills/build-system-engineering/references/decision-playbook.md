# Build System Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from repository-owned commands, declared toolchain/lock inputs, build graph, artifact provenance, supported consumers and target release/deployment behavior.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Discover the actual build graph, generated sources, toolchain versions and environment inputs before changing build configuration.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 2. Separate source-generation, compile, link/package and test artifacts with explicit dependencies so incremental builds remain correct.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 3. Treat build cache correctness as a hashing/input problem

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 4. For native builds, manage compiler/linker flags, ABI, architecture, sysroot and dependency discovery intentionally across target platforms.

- **Watch for:** ambiguous output/exit semantics, shell quoting/path/Unicode breakage, prompts in automation, partial writes or destructive scope that cannot be previewed.
- **Prove with:** TTY and non-TTY runs, representative shells/paths/Unicode, success/error exit codes, machine-readable output and cancellation/partial-write cases.
- **Safe change pattern:** treat grammar/stdout/stderr/exit codes as a public contract, keep non-interactive mode deterministic and provide dry-run/explicit scope for destructive operations where practical.

## 5. Avoid bespoke build scripting when the ecosystem build system already expresses the graph reliably

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 6. Measure clean and incremental build performance separately and optimize the critical path rather than blindly parallelizing.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 7. CI and local builds should converge on the same canonical commands and toolchain constraints.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.
