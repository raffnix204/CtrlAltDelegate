# SQLite Vector Search Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from data ownership, schema/cardinality, representative access/write patterns, consistency/transaction boundaries, retention and production-scale evidence.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Verify the actual SQLite/vector extension available at runtime. Prefer official/current supported mechanisms where they fit

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.

## 2. Define embedding model, dimension, normalization, distance metric and version as schema-level data

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.

## 3. Separate canonical documents/chunks from vector index rows so embeddings can be rebuilt without losing source truth.

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.

## 4. Use metadata/partition filtering before or within vector search where supported, and test filter+ANN recall rather than assuming equivalence to global search.

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.

## 5. For knowledge/search products, compare vector-only with FTS5 lexical and hybrid fusion

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.

## 6. Evaluate recall/precision on representative queries, latency, index size and rebuild cost before choosing ANN parameters or quantization.

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.

## 7. Design local embedding generation, remote embedding calls, batching, caching and privacy boundaries explicitly

- **Watch for:** evaluation leakage, model/prompt/corpus/index drift, authorization loss through retrieval, hallucinated authority, unsafe tool/data access or cost/latency regressions hidden by toy inputs.
- **Prove with:** frozen representative evals with model/prompt/corpus/index versions, retrieval/ranking or task metrics as applicable, negative/adversarial cases and latency/cost/error traces.
- **Safe change pattern:** version every behavior-changing input, separate retrieval from synthesis/tool authority, gate rollout on discriminating evals and retain rollback to the last proven configuration.
