# Open Source Release Engineering — Decision Playbook

## Use this reference when

Read this file only when a material decision, production failure path, rollout/recovery question or verification ambiguity needs deeper probes. Start from repository-owned commands, declared toolchain/lock inputs, build graph, artifact provenance, supported consumers and target release/deployment behavior.

Current first-party documentation and live repository/runtime evidence remain authoritative for version-sensitive behavior. External skill libraries are research prompts, not executable policy.

## 1. Work from a staging branch/copy and inventory secrets, credentials, private endpoints, customer data, internal names and proprietary dependencies before publishing.

- **Watch for:** over-privileged identities, secret exposure, missing revocation/rotation, confused-deputy behavior or sensitive material leaking into logs/artifacts.
- **Prove with:** effective scopes/roles plus positive and negative permission cases, redacted telemetry and rotation/revocation or signature/certificate validation where relevant.
- **Safe change pattern:** use dedicated least-privilege identities, external secret storage and short-lived/rotatable credentials where supported.

## 2. Scan current files and relevant Git history

- **Watch for:** untrusted input crossing a trust boundary, parser/format ambiguity, partial writes, unbounded resource use, metadata/provenance loss or derived data that cannot be rebuilt.
- **Prove with:** representative valid/invalid/adversarial fixtures, round-trip/checksum/metadata invariants, bounded-resource behavior and final consumer/read-back evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** preserve source/provenance, validate before promotion, stream/bound expensive work, write atomically or through durable staging and keep derivatives rebuildable.

## 3. Choose a license deliberately and verify third-party licenses, notices and generated/vendor assets are compatible with redistribution.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 4. Replace private integrations/config with documented placeholders or adapters and provide a safe `.env.example`.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 5. Ensure setup, tests and examples work from a clean public environment without private registries or infrastructure.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 6. Add contribution/security/reporting guidance proportional to expected community use.

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.

## 7. Public repository creation/push requires explicit project intent

- **Watch for:** non-reproducible local residue, stale caches/generated output, dependency substitution, environment-only success, compatibility breaks or artifacts not traceable to immutable source.
- **Prove with:** clean-checkout canonical build/test/install, declared toolchain/lock inputs, intentional generated/artifact diffs, provenance/signature where supported and target smoke/rollback evidence.
- **Safe change pattern:** let CI/release orchestrate repository-owned commands, separate caches from immutable artifacts, pin/record behavior-changing inputs and preserve a known-good promotion/rollback path.
